[GiveHub](http://give-hub.herokuapp.com/) provides a common space for charities to list current needs for their recipients and solicit donations from the community.  Registered users accessing GiveHub can donate to a recipient from a particular charity, or find a recipient by searching a specific cause of his or her interest.

GiveHub was a team project focused on learning brownfield development by pivoting a highly customized single-tenant e-commerce website into a  multi tenancy application that could be generalized to a variety of charities. This was created by [Marcella Wigg](https://github.com/marcellawigg), [Kerry Sheldon](https://github.com/kjs222), and [Nick Pisciotta](https://github.com/nickpisciotta), as part of the [Turing School of Software & Design's](https://www.turing.io/) Module 3 curriculum. This was adapted from the previous code base, [refugeerestore](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/little_shop).

This site exercises the concepts of multitenancy, well-designed seed files, rails-app security, and integrating JavaScript via jQuery search fields and chartJS for business analytics.
